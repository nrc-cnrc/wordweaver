Configuration
==============

There are four configuration files (yaml) that inform WordWeaver. 

    * A **build** configuration file that informs the `Build Tools <wordweaver>`_
    * An **environment** configuration file that specifies certain run-time variables and security policies
    * An **interface** configuration file that specifies the way that WordWeaver interacts with the language model 
    * A **language** configuration file that specifies variables about the language. 

Below is an in-depth description of each configuration file. However, we recommend just altering
the `sample configuration files <https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/wordweaver/tree/master/wordweaver/sample/configs>`_
instead of writing yours from scratch. 

For help on how to change specific things about your WordWeaver instance, check out the :ref:`guides` section.
