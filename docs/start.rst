What is Word Weaver?
************************************

Word Weaver is a Python library for turning an FST made with `Foma <https://fomafst.github.io/>`_ into a RESTful API. It combines with the Word Weaver GUI to create an interactive web application for the data as well.
Word Weaver was initially built for `Kanyen'k√©ha <https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-4806>`_ but with all Iroquoian languages in mind. It will likely work for similar polysynthetic languages and Foma FSTs that model inflectional verbal morphology, but
non-Iroquoian languages will likely have to modify the source in order to work.
