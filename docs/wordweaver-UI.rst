WordWeaver UI
==============================

The WordWeaver User Interface is one way to *visualize* the data that 
WordWeaver makes accessible through its API. 

The interface is an Angular web application and is available here at https://github.com/roedoejet/wordweaver-GUI.

Edits to the interface for your particular instance of WordWeaver 
should be purely stylistic, most of the other changes should be able to be done through the :ref:`configuration` files.
